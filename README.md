# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
The above project is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The game includes player input handling, move validation and win/draw detection. This project demonstrates the use of 2D arrays, loops, conditional statements, and user interaction in Java.
