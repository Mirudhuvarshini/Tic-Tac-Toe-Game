# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Java. It allows two players to take turns marking positions on a 3x3 grid using 'X' and 'O'. The application handles player input, validates moves, and determines the game outcome (win or draw). </br>The project demonstrates core Java programming concepts and fundamental problem-solving skills.

---

## Objectives
- Implement a two-player interactive console game
- Practice Java fundamentals such as arrays and control structures
- Implement game logic for win/draw detection
- Validate user input and prevent invalid moves

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- OOPS Concept
- Console-based User Interaction

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- 2D Arrays for board representation
- Loops for game flow control
- Conditional statements for win checking
- Input handling using Scanner class
- Basic game logic implementation
- Turn-based player switching

---

## Game Features
- 3x3 game board
- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)
- Input validation for row and column positions
- Prevention of overwriting existing moves
- Automatic win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Draw detection when board is full
- Clear console output display of board state

---

## Game Flow
1. The game board is initialized.
2. Players take turns entering row and column positions.
3. The program checks:
   - If the move is valid
   - If a player has won
   - If the game ends in a draw
4. The game ends when a win or draw condition is met.
